# google-code-export
On March 12th, 2015, Google announced Google Code's shutdown. This is an export using the automatic Google Code exporter from https://code.google.com/p/team178first.

Since this export is for archiving purposes, I let the exporter software merge the 17 projects from 2009-2012 into one repository here. We should consider this repository as read-only, and use it for wisdom. :)
